For nearly a century, America led the world in manufacturing. And since our founding, we've held to a simple tradition: when the chips are down, we put our country first.

Today, we honor that great legacy in our own small way by making our manufacturing software open source. We believe this can help America rebuild our manufacturing strength.

This isn't a business plan. This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. This is a working foundation for building a scalable, high-tech manufacturing company without spending years and millions of dollars on standing up your own software stack. Because there's no time to waste.

Do your thing, America.
