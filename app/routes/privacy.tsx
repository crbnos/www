              may collect certain information automatically through your use of

                  <strong>Account Creation.</strong> In order to create your
                  account on the Platform, your organization will need to
                  provide information. This information will include, at a
                  minimum, your name, email address, and you may provide a photo
                  if you choose. We use this information so that we can provide
                  you with access to the Platform, perform our contract with
                  you, and communicate with you about your account and the
                  accounts for Organizations that you are affiliated with on the
                  Platform. In addition, we may use your email address to send

                  <strong>Work Activity.</strong> You will have the option to
                  log work activity to the Platform, and to modify the work
                  activity of others within the Organizations when they log work
                  activity Platform (collectively, “User Content”). If you or
                  the Organizations choose to use Third Party Apps in connection
                  with the Platform, you will be able to log User Content to the
                  Platform from those Third Party Apps.

                  record information on our server logs from your browser or
                  device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data,

                  device you’re using to access the Platform, the amount of time
                  spent on the Platform, and the page or feature you requested.
                  We use the data we automatically collect to diagnose and fix
                  issues with the Platform, and to improve the Platform – for
                  example, this data can tell us how often users use a
                  particular feature of the Platform, and we can use that
                  knowledge to make the Platform interesting to as many users as
                  possible.

                <strong>Personnel and Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We
                employ personnel and engage other companies and people to
                perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your personal
                information with them to provide products or services to you.
                For example, we use Amazon Web Services to store files and
                images that users post to the Platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Organization Access.</strong> Please note that if you
                submit any personal information or User Content to a portion of
                the Platform that is accessible by other users within an
                Organization, other users affiliated with the Organization will
                be able to see that personal information and User Content.
                Accordingly, only include personal information in such
                submissions that you are comfortable sharing with other users
                affiliated with the Organization.

                <strong>Third Party Apps.</strong> If you or an Organization use
                Third Party Apps within the Platform, Carbon will allow the
                Third Party Providers to access or use your personal information
                and User Content as required for the interoperation of the Third
                Party Apps and the Platform. Any Third Party Provider’s use of
                your personal information and User Content is subject to the
                applicable agreement between either (i) the applicable
                Organization and such Third Party Provider, or (ii) you and the
                Third Party Provider. Carbon is not responsible for any access
                to or use of your personal information or User Content by Third
                Party Providers. You and the Organizations are solely
                responsible for the decision to permit any Third Party Provider
                to use your personal information or User Content.

              <li>
                <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If we (or our assets) are
                acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go
                through some other change of control, personal information could
                be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third
                party.
              </li>

                <strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> We reserve the right to

                believe is necessary to comply with governmental requests, law
                or court order, or enforce or apply our Terms of Service and

              physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the

              we rely on the technical safeguards provided by the third party
              service providers we use to host, store, and process your personal
              information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant that your
              personal information on the Platform may not be accessed,
              disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
              technical, or managerial safeguards. We are not responsible to our
              users or to any third party due to any such loss, misuse, or
              alteration.

                <strong>Your rights.</strong> Because we have collected your
                personal information as a result of the Organization Agreements,
                we are a “processor” of your personal information and the
                Organizations control our use of your personal information and
                determine how and for what purpose we process your personal
                information. If you have any questions or concerns about how
                your personal information is handled or would like to exercise
                rights you may have as a data subject (including the
                modification and deletion of your personal information), you
                should contact the applicable Organizations. We will provide
                assistance to the Organizations to address any concerns you may
                have, in accordance with the terms of the Organization
                Agreements and applicable law.

              <p>
                Subject to your right to request deletion of your personal
                information, we will retain your personal information as long as
                needed for your use of the Platform, your approved receipt of
                marketing communications from us, our compliance with legal
                obligations, and to protect our or other’s interests.

              <strong>How we respond to Do Not Track signals.</strong> We do not
              track you or collect your personal information across third party
              websites or online services. Thus, we do not receive Do-Not-Track
              signals, or other similar signals. To the extent that we do
              receive any such signals, we will not comply with them as it is
              not an aspect of the functionality of the Platform.

            <li>
              <strong>Changes to policy.</strong> We’re constantly trying to
              improve the Platform, so we may need to change this Policy from
              time to time as well. The date of the last modification will also
              be posted at the beginning of this Policy. It is your
              responsibility to check from time to time for updates. By
              continuing to access or use the Platform, you are indicating that
              you agree to be bound by the modified Policy.
