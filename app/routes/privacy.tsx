              <strong>Security of Personal Information</strong>

                  We take the security of your Personal Information seriously
                  and implement commercially reasonable physical, technical, 
                  and administrative safeguards to protect it from unauthorized

                </p>
                <p>
                  We also rely on the technical infrastructure and security 
                  practices of third-party service providers who host, store,
                  or process data on our behalf. For example, we use Amazon Web Services 
                  (AWS) for secure data storage and transmission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These safeguards include access controls, encryption in transit and 
                  at rest where appropriate, routine monitoring, and periodic security 
                  assessments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of

                  Despite our efforts, we are not liable to you or any third party for 
                  any unauthorized access to, misuse of, or alteration of your Personal 
                  Information that occurs due to a breach of our safeguards or those of our

              <strong>Do Not Track</strong> 
          <p>
              The Platform does not track your activity across third-party websites or 
              online services over time. As a result, we do not respond to “Do Not Track” 
              (DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers or other 
              devices.
            </li>
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent we do receive any such signals, we do not take action in response, 
            as cross-site tracking is not a feature of the Platform.
