                <strong>Organization Access.</strong> Please note that if you
                submit any personal information or User Content to a portion of
                the Platform that is accessible by other users within an
                Organization, other users affiliated with the Organization will
                be able to see that personal information and User Content.
                Accordingly, only include personal information in such
                submissions that you are comfortable sharing with other users
                affiliated with the Organization.

                <strong>Third Party Apps.</strong> If you or an Organization use

                and User Content as required for the interoperation of the Third
                Party Apps and the Platform. Any Third Party Provider’s use of

                applicable agreement between either (i) the applicable
                Organization and such Third Party Provider, or (ii) you and the
                Third Party Provider. Carbon is not responsible for any access
                to or use of your personal information or User Content by Third
                Party Providers. You and the Organizations are solely
                responsible for the decision to permit any Third Party Provider

                <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If we (or our assets) are
                acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go
                through some other change of control, personal information could
                be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third

                or court order, or enforce or apply our Terms of Service and

              physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the

              we rely on the technical safeguards provided by the third party
              service providers we use to host, store, and process your personal
              information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant that your

              disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
              technical, or managerial safeguards. We are not responsible to our

                <strong>Your rights.</strong> Because we have collected your
                personal information as a result of the Organization Agreements,
                we are a “processor” of your personal information and the
                Organizations control our use of your personal information and
                determine how and for what purpose we process your personal
                information. If you have any questions or concerns about how
                your personal information is handled or would like to exercise
                rights you may have as a data subject (including the
                modification and deletion of your personal information), you
                should contact the applicable Organizations. We will provide
                assistance to the Organizations to address any concerns you may
                have, in accordance with the terms of the Organization
                Agreements and applicable law.

              <p>
                Subject to your right to request deletion of your personal
                information, we will retain your personal information as long as
                needed for your use of the Platform, your approved receipt of
                marketing communications from us, our compliance with legal
                obligations, and to protect our or other’s interests.

              <strong>How we respond to Do Not Track signals.</strong> We do not
              track you or collect your personal information across third party
              websites or online services. Thus, we do not receive Do-Not-Track
              signals, or other similar signals. To the extent that we do
              receive any such signals, we will not comply with them as it is
              not an aspect of the functionality of the Platform.

              <strong>Changes to policy.</strong> We’re constantly trying to

              time to time as well. The date of the last modification will also
              be posted at the beginning of this Policy. It is your
              responsibility to check from time to time for updates. By
              continuing to access or use the Platform, you are indicating that
              you agree to be bound by the modified Policy.
