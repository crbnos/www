          <h3>Subscription Terms and Billing</h3>
          <p>
            Certain features of the Service are made available to Customers on a subscription 
            basis (“Subscription”). Subscription fees are billed in advance on a recurring 
            and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”), which may be monthly, annually, or as 
            otherwise agreed at the time of purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise stated, each Subscription will automatically renew at the end of 
            the applicable Billing Cycle for a successive period of equal length and under the 
            same terms, unless the Customer provides written notice of non-renewal at least 
            thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current term.
          </p>
          <p>
            This renewal policy applies to both of the following subscription types:
          </p>
          <p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Subscription via Self-Signup on Website:</strong></li>
              Customers who subscribed through Carbon’s website must submit cancellation through 
              their <strong>account settings</strong> or by <strong>emailing support@carbon.ms</strong> 
              at least thirty (30) days before the current term ends to avoid automatic renewal.
              <p></p>
              <li><strong>Subscription via Subscription Agreement (SA) or Order Form:</strong></li>
              Customers who subscribe through a negotiated agreement must submit written notice of 
              non-renewal (email or formal letter) at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of 
              the current term to avoid renewal.
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            A valid and current payment method (such as a credit card) is required to process 
            payments. You agree to provide accurate and complete billing information, including 
            your full name, billing address, telephone number, and payment details. By providing 
            such information, you authorize Carbon to automatically charge the applicable 
            Subscription fees and any applicable taxes using your designated payment method.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event automatic billing is unsuccessful, Carbon may issue an electronic invoice. 
            You agree to remit full payment by the deadline stated on the invoice. Failure to pay 
            may result in the suspension or termination of access to the Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for
            reasons including but not limited to: product or service
            availability, errors in the description or price of the product or
            service, error in your order or other reasons.
          </p>

          <p>
            We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an
            unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
          </p>

          <h3><strong>Customer and End User Roles</strong></h3>
          <p>
            A <strong>"Customer"</strong> is the individual or legal entity that enters into a 
            subscription or service agreement with Carbon to access and use the Service. If the 
            Customer represents an organization, the individual accepting these Terms represents 
            and warrants that they have the authority to bind that organization and its authorized 
            users to these Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            An <strong>"End User"</strong> is any individual who accesses or uses the Service under 
            the Customer’s account, whether as an employee, contractor, or other representative of the 
            Customer. End Users are granted access by the discretion of the customer or by virtue of the 
            Customer’s agreement with Carbon.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Customer is responsible for all activity occurring under its account, including actions 
            taken by End Users. The Customer shall ensure that all End Users comply with this Agreement 
            and shall be liable for any breach of these Terms by its End Users.
          </p>

          <h3>Free Trial</h3>
          <p>
            Carbon may, at its sole discretion, offer access to certain features of the Service on a trial 
            basis at no charge for a limited time (“Free Trial”). The specific terms of any Free Trial, 
            including duration and access scope, will be described at the time of the offer.
          </p>

          <p>
            To activate a Free Trial, you may be required to provide valid billing information. If billing 
            information is provided, you will not be charged until the Free Trial period expires. Unless you 
            cancel your Subscription prior to the end of the Free Trial, the applicable Subscription fees 
            will be automatically charged to your designated payment method on the first day following the 
            Free Trial period.
          </p>

          <p>
            Free Trials are intended for evaluation purposes only and may not be used to create or process data 
            for commercial use unless explicitly permitted by Carbon. Carbon reserves the right to (i) modify 
            or terminate any Free Trial offer at any time without prior notice, and (ii) determine your 
            eligibility for a Free Trial at its sole discretion.
          </p>

          <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
          <p>
            Carbon may adjust Subscription fees at its sole discretion. Any such changes will take effect at the 
            start of the next applicable Billing Cycle.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Customer will be notified of fee changes via email or through the Service. Continued use of the 
            Service after the effective date of the revised fees constitutes the Customer’s acceptance of the new 
            pricing.
          </p>

          <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
          <p>
            All payments made in connection with the Service are non-refundable, except as expressly required by 
            applicable law.
          </p>

          <p>
            No credits or refunds will be provided for partial use, unused periods, downgrades, or cancellations 
            within an active Billing Cycle. Customers are responsible for reviewing the Service and Subscription 
            details before purchase.

          <p>
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the

            shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or
            condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
            failure of Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall

          <p>
            If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
            competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for
            any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the
            minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will
